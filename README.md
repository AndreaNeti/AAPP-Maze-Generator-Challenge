# AAPP - Maze-Generator-Challenge
Advanced Algorithms and Parallel Programming Maze Generator Challenge - a.a. 2022-2023<br>
**Professor:** [Fabrizio Ferrandi](https://ferrandi.faculty.polimi.it/)
## The challenge 
The goal of this challenge was to implement a maze generator using the [disjoint-sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure) data structure with 3 of its different implementations (linked-list, forest and union by rank).<br>
This challenge granted me 4 out of 4 points in the "Advanced Algorithms" partial exam.<br>
The code and the documentation was wrote on Google Colab and can be found [here](mazegenerator.ipynb).
